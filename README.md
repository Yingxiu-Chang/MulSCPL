# Multi-Supervised Contrastive Prospective Learning (MulSCPL) for Visual-based Mapless UAV Indoor Autonomous Navigation
This repository contains the trained MulSCPL model, codes for UAV control policy and experimental videos.

## Introduction
The MulSCPL aims to simultaneously learn the prospective regression-aware and classification-aware representations based on contrastive learning for Visual-based Mapless UAV Indoor Autonomous Navigation. The experiments were conducted in real-world environments upon Nano-UAV (Crazyflie). We released our trained MulSCPL model along with codes for convenient verification and shared the recorded videos.
